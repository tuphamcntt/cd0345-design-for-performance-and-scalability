"Based on the Initial_Cost_Estimate.csv, here are several ways I suggest to improve performance:",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,1. Increase the number of web/app servers from 8 to 16 instances.,,,,,,,
,"2. Upgrade the Master database in PostgreSQL from db.r6g.2xlarge to db.r6g.8xlarge, and the Read replica database from db.r6g.xlarge to db.r6g.4xlarge.",,,,,,,
,3. Utilize 30GB of Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) to provide a scalable and highly available file system that can be accessed from multiple EC2 instances.,,,,,,,
,4. Update Route 53 with Geo DNS queries and Latency based routing queries to optimize routing to the closest and most responsive resources.,,,,,,,
,"5. Implement Amazon CloudWatch Logs to collect, monitor, and analyze log data from infrastructure and applications.",,,,,,,
